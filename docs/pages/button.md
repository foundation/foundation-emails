Creating a bullet-proof button that works in all email clients requires a table nested inside of a table. Put the class `.button` on the outer `<table>`. Inside of the inner table, put an `<a>` with an `href` attribute containing your link.

In Inky HTML, the `<button>` tag creates all of this markup for you.

```inky_example
<button href="zurb.com">Button</button>
```

## Sizing

By default, buttons are sized by the content and padding within them. You can also size a button according to it's parent container (see Expanded section).

Buttons can be made larger or smaller by adding the class `.tiny`, `.small`, or `.large` to a button's outer `<table>`.

In Inky HTML, add the same class to the `<button>` tag.

```inky_example
<button href="#" class="tiny">Tiny Button</button>
<button href="#" class="small">Small Button</button>
<button href="#">Default Button</button>
<button href="#" class="large">Large Button</button>
```

Don't forget the `href=""` ;)

## Expanded

To create an expanded button (full width of it's container), add the class `.expanded` to the outer `<table>` of the button, and wrap a `<center>` tag around the `<a>`.

In Inky HTML, add the `.expanded` class to the `<button>` tag.

```inky_example
<row>
  <columns>
    <button href="zurb.com" class="expanded">Expanded Button</button>
  </columns>
</row>
```

## Coloring

Change the background color of a button by adding the class `.secondary`, `.success`, `.warning`, or `.alert` to the outer `<table>` (or the `<button>` tag in Inky HTML).

```inky_example
<button href="zurb.com" class="secondary">Secondary Button</button>
<button href="zurb.com" class="success">Success Button</button>
<button href="zurb.com" class="warning">Warning Button</button>
<button href="zurb.com" class="alert">Alert Button</button>
```

## Radius and Round

Creating buttons with a radius or rounded edges (like a pill) can be achieved by adding the `.radius` or `.rounded` class to a button.

*Note - border-radius is not supported on Outlook 2000-2013, Yahoo! Mail, and Android 4+ (Gmail)*

*Note - In order to create `.radius` and `.rounded` buttons, the border needs to be removed.*

```inky_example
<button href="#" class="radius">Radius</button>
<button href="#" class="rounded">Round</button>

```
